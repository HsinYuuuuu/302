<h1>Lyrics-Daylight by Taylor Swift</h1>
<h2> [Verse 1]&nbsp;</h2>
<p>My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in<br>
Everyone looked worse in the light&nbsp;<br>
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven<br>
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye<br></p>
<h2>[Chorus]&nbsp;</h2>
<p>I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you<br>
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you<br>
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night&nbsp;<br>
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight</p>
<h2>[Verse 2]&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky<br>
And so I became the butt of the joke<br>
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked<br>
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke<br>
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down<br>
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town<br>
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now It's brighter now, now&nbsp;</p>
<h2>[Chorus]&nbsp;</h2>
<p>I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you<br>
(I can never look away)<br>
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you<br>
(Things will never be the same)<br>
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night<br>
(Now I'm wide awake)<br>
And now I see daylight<br>
(Daylight),<br>
I only see daylight <br>
	(Daylight)<br>
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight&nbsp;</p>
<h2>[Bridge]&nbsp;</h2>
<p>And I can still see it all<br>
(In my mind)<br>
All of you, all of me<br>
(Intertwined)<br>
I once believed love would be<br>
(Black and white)<br>
But it's golden<br>
(Golden)<br>
And I can still see it all<br>
(In my head)<br>
Back and forth from New York<br>
(Sneaking in your bed)<br>
I once believed love would be<br>
(Burning red)<br>
But it's golden<br>
Like daylight, like daylight Like daylight, daylight&nbsp;</p>
<h2>[Chorus]&nbsp;</h2>
<p>I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you<br>
(I can never look away)<br>
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you<br>
(Things will never be the same)<br>
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night<br>
(Now I'm wide awake)<br>
And now I see daylight<br>
(I see daylight),<br>
I only see daylight (Ah)<br>
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)<br>
(And I can still see it all)<br>
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight<br>
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)<br>
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight<br>
(I once believed love would be burning red)</p>
<h3>[Outro]&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Like daylight<br>
It's golden like daylight<br>
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go<br>
Just let it go, let it go&nbsp;</p>
<h3>[Spoken Outro]&nbsp;</h3>
<h4>I wanna be defined by the things that I love<br>
Not the things I hate<br>
Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of<br>
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night<br>
I, I just think that&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>"You are what you love"</h4>
<h5>[Storyline]&nbsp;</h5><ul>
  <h6><li>I chose "Daylight" as the last song on the album because it recognizes past damage and pain but shows that it doesn't have to define you.</li>
  <li>For me, the 'reputation' album seemed like nightime. The 'Lover' album feels completely sunlit.</li>
  <li>I wrote this one alone.&nbsp;</li></h6>
</ul>
